# RESET_API_in_go
Me first API written in Go 

A small REST API application in which we can view a list of books or one book, delete, update and add books to the list.


Follow the [link](http://127.0.0.1:8000/books) to see the project results.

To check that PUT, DELETE and POST requests work, we'll use Postman. 

We write the json that we want to send for adding
For example:
{
    "title": "To the Lighthouse",
    "author": {
        "firstname": "Virginia",
        "lastname": "Woolf"
    }
}
